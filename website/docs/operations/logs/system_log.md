After being successfully started, Kylin will create a directory named `logs/` by default, all logs generated during Kylin runtime will be stored in this directory.

### Log files
Log files generated by Kylin is as followings.

#### `kylin.log`
This file is Kylin's main log file, whose default logging level is DEBUG.

#### `kylin.out`
The standard output of Kylin process will be redirected to this file, including the output of Tomcat and Hive.

#### `kylin.gc`
This file is the GC(Garbage Collection) log of Kylin Java process. And it appends pid as filename suffix to avoid being overwritten.

#### `access.log`
This file stores the Tomcat access log. It records all HTTP request response information.For example, User-Agent, access URL, etc.

#### `jstack.timed.log`

This file records Java stack traces of Java threads of Kylin, which is used to record some threads running status. To avoid the storage overused, only 20 log files can be kept. The new file will replace the oldest one, when exceeding the maximum number. 

> Note:Because the execution of jstack depends on the .java_pid file written by jvm in the /tmp directory, if the file is deleted (for example, a scheduled clean up script), it will cause the jstack to not run properly, so that the jstack.timed .log will not be generated

#### `check-env.out`
The standard output of executing `check-env.sh` script will be redirected to this file.

#### `check-env.error`
The error message of executing `check-env.sh` script will be redirected to this file.

#### `shell.stderr`
The result of running command lines will be stored in this file.

#### `shell.stdout`
The standard output of running command lines will be redirected to this file.

#### `kylin.security.log`

The log of system start, stop, upgrade, login and logout will be redirected to this file.

> Notes: When using LDAP service to implement user authentication, two logs will be recorded for each login failure. Because when using the LDAP service, if the login fails, another method will be used for authentication.

#### `kylin.schedule.log`
This file records logs related to task scheduling, whose default logging level is DEBUG.

#### `kylin.query.log`
This file records query related logs, whose default logging level is DEBUG.

#### `kylin.build.log`
This file records build-related logs, whose default logging level is DEBUG.

#### `kylin.metadata.log`
This file records metadata and transaction operations related logs, whose default logging level is DEBUG.

#### `dump.hprof`
When Out of Memory (OOM) occurs in Kylin, it will dump the entire heap, which is convenient for checking the cause.
> Note: When you have a large memory setting and Out of Memory OOM occurs, the file dump.hprof will occupy a large storage space, which may cause your disk space to be insufficient and the node to be abnormal. You can manually clean up the historical file.

### Logging Analysis
Take query as an example, submitting a query on Web UI, and we'll see the following information in `kylin.query.log` 


```

* `Is Refused`: Whether to refuse to query

### Logging Configuration

Kylin uses log4j2 to configure logs. Users can edit the `kylin-server-log4j.xml` file in the `$KYLIN_HOME/server/conf/` directory to modify the log level, path, etc.
After modification, you need to restart Kylin for the configuration to take effect.

The configuration of all logs starting with kylin and ending with log is in `kylin-server-log4j.xml`, the configuration code is as follows.

```xml
        <Routing name="routing">
            <Routes pattern="$${ctx:logCategory}">
                <Route>
                    <RollingFile name="rolling-${ctx:logCategory}"
                                 fileName="${env:KYLIN_HOME}/logs/kylin.${ctx:logCategory}.log"
                                 filePattern="${env:KYLIN_HOME}/logs/kylin.${ctx:logCategory}.log.%i">
                        <Policies>
                            <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="268435456"/>
                        </Policies>
                        <DefaultRolloverStrategy max="10"/>
                        <PatternLayout pattern="%d{ISO8601} %-5p %X{request.project}[%t] %c{2} : %mask{%m}%n"/>
                    </RollingFile>
                </Route>

                <Route ref="server" key="$${ctx:logCategory}"/>
            </Routes>
        </Routing>

```

In the default configuration, log rolling is triggered when the log file reaches 256MB, keeping the last 10 log files.

If you need to configure one of the log files (such as kylin.query.log) separately, you need to add a new Route under the Routes configuration in the above configuration code, and configure the key as the corresponding log file name (query, schedule).
It should be noted that the new route needs to be configured before the existing route, otherwise it will not take effect.

The following is an example, modify the rolling strategy of kylin.query.log to trigger at 0:00 every day, back up the last 5 logs.

```xml
<Route key="query">
    <RollingFile name="rolling-${ctx:logCategory}" fileName="${env:KYLIN_HOME}/logs/kylin.${ctx:logCategory}.log" filePattern="${env:KYLIN_HOME}/logs/kylin.${ctx:logCategory}.log.%i">
        <Policies>
            <CronTriggeringPolicy schedule="0 0 0 * * ?"/>
        </Policies>
        <DefaultRolloverStrategy max="5" />
        <PatternLayout pattern="%d{ISO8601} %-5p %X{request.project}[%t] %c{2} : %mask{%m}%n" />
    </RollingFile>
</Route>
```

If you need to configure kylin.log, you can modify the RollingRandomAccessFile configuration, for example, change the number of reserved files to 5

```xml
<RollingRandomAccessFile name="server" fileName="${env:KYLIN_HOME}/logs/kylin.log" append="true"
                         filePattern="${env:KYLIN_HOME}/logs/kylin.log.%i" immediateFlush="false" >
    <Policies>
        <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="268435456"/>
    </Policies>
    <DefaultRolloverStrategy max="5"/>
    <PatternLayout pattern="%d{ISO8601} %-5p %X{request.project}[%t] %c{2} : %mask{%m}%n"/>
</RollingRandomAccessFile>
```

### Error Code In Log

The format of log error code is KE-AABBBCCC, AA refers to the error reporting module, BBB refers to the more detailed business error reporting and CCC refers to the error number.
